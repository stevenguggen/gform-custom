# wp-plugin-boilerplate

## this should get you started. just follow the conventions outlined

- first i would rename every instance of my_plugin to an actual name
- ideally i would like to write some sort of script that automates this boilerplate but this repo should at least be helpful
- just rename my_plugin and then follow the conventions

1. git clone the repo
2. find/replace all instances of my_plugin
3. cd into the root of the plugin and rm -rf .git
4. now you can either do a fresh git init and add the remote of a new repo, or let it fall under a greater repo
5. just follow the conventions and develop away
6. this is a class-based wordpress plugin with auto-loading. enjoy.
